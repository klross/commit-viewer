README -

Open commit_viewer.py file and run the script.

You will be asked to input the URL of the repository from which you want to obtain a commit list.
If the app is unable to get the commit list using GitHub's API, it will resort to cloning the repository and using the git CLI to obtain the commit history.
Therefore, you will be asked to input a path for the cloning location.
If the directory already exists, enter that path instead. 

Note: if fallback to CLI function occurs, data will be pesisted as was instructed in Part 2.2.



TO DO:

- Add timeout in case API requests (Part 3) take too long

- Write automated tests file with lists of repos

- Log code 

- Add authentification option

- Check inputed paths
